This directory contains codes used for simulations (under a sequential fixation regime) and/or generating figures.

#functions.R 
Contains functions that are used (often repeatedly) in other files. 

#sim_basic.R 
For generating model predictions for an editing-type modification event with only the cis-loci evolving (results shown in Fig. 2).

#sim_as.R
For generating model predictions for of an splicing-type modification event with only the cis-loci evolving (results shown in Fig. S1-S2).

#sim_evo.R
For simulating the coevolution of cis-loci underlying an arbitrary number of editing-type modification events and a trans-genotypic value characterizing the global modification activity (results shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3-S4).

#sim_evo_tree.R
For simulating the evolution of an editing-type modification events along a phylogenetic tree, with only the cis-loci evolving (results shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5).

#plot_sim.R
For analyzing results and generating of the plots.

This directory contains codes used for simulations and/or generating figures.

sim_basic.R generates model predictions for an individual editing-type modification events with only the cis-loci evolving.

sim_as.R generates model predictions for an individual splicing-type modification events with only the cis-loci evolving.

sim_evo.R is for simulating cis-trans coevolution.

sim_evo_tree.R is for simulating cis-loci evolution along a phylogenetic tree.

plot_sim.R is for analyzing results and generating some of the plots.

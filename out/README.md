This directory is for data files generated in simulations.

# out_editing_type.txt 
Expected modification level of editing-type gene product modifications under different conditions. Each row is for a parameter combination. Generated by codes in sim_editing_type.R and used to generate Fig. 2.

# out_splicing_type.txt 
Expected modification level of splicing-type gene product modifications under different conditions. Each row is for a parameter combination. Generated by codes in sim_splicing_type.R and used to generate Fig. EV1-EV2.

# cis_trans_coevolution.zip 
Contains results of simulations where cis- and trans-acting loci both evolved. The data are generated by code of sim_cis-trans_coevolution.R, and used by plot_cis-trans_coevolution.R to generate plots in Fig. 3, Fig. EV3, and Fig. EV4.

## Directories
Data files are organized into 3 folders according to the number of cis-loci per modification event. Folders named "l=2", "l=5", and "l=10" are for simulations with 2, 5, and 10 cis-loci, respectively. In each of these folders, there are folders for simulations of different timescales. For instance, folder named "T=5" is for simulations that lasted for 10^5 time steps.

## Modification levels
Files names follow the format "lv_out_(total number of modification events)_(log10 effective population size).txt" format. The number of modification is the same for all simulations (100), so the corresponding part is in all file names. Each row in the data file corresponds to a replicate lineage simulated, and each column corresponds to a modification event

## trans-genotypic value
Files names follow the format "trans_out_(total number of modification events)_(log10 effective population size).txt" format. Each files has 1 column, and each row corresponds to a replicate lineage.

## Fitness
Files names follow the format "fitness_out_(total number of modification events)_(log10 effective population size).txt" format. Each files has 1 column, and each row corresponds to a replicate lineage.

# Simulations along a tree
Both data files contain results from simulations along the Coleoidea tree. The data files are genrated using code in sim_evo_tree.R, and are used to generate Fig. 4 and Fig. EV5.

## out_sim_tree_deleterious.txt
Result from simulation where all modification events are deleterious.

## out_sim_tree_neutral.txt
Result from simulation where all modification events are neutral.
